## Questions

In all seriousness, this is just a fun little toy to learn a little about github's 
hubot. 

The inspiration for this particular toy came from spongebob squarepants. Namely, the 
"Club Spongebob" episode from season three. All conch responses were taken from the [spongebob wikia](http://spongebob.wikia.com/wiki/Club_SpongeBob).

If you want to make one of your own, see github's hubot page at [https://hubot.github.com/](https://hubot.github.com/).
