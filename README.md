The magic conch will also recognize any who identify themselves as club members.

## Project

Becaues ES6 is the new hotness, I didn't settle for writing coffeescript, or ES5, 
like some kind of dirty peasant. And I added a plethora of new features to boot! 
Things like cleaning, linting, and transpiling! Oh boy!

Should you want to make the conch more robust, edit `src/conch.js` as you see fit. 
When you're done, run `npm start` in your terminal to clean, lint, transpile and test.

In all seriousness, this was just a fun little exercise in learning about github's 
hubot. 

The inspiration for this particular toy came from spongebob squarepants. Namely, the 
"Club Spongebob" episode from season three. All conch responses were taken from the 
[spongebob wikia](http://spongebob.wikia.com/wiki/Club_SpongeBob).

## Questions

Pretty straightforward little toy. Feel free to email me with any questions.
